# predict_RBP_binding

My project will be focused on predicting RNA binding proteins, delving into the significance of RNA in regulating alternative splicing, translation, localization, etc. Specifically on which motifs in the RNA sequence the proteins will bind to, the function of the proteins, whether mutations in the RNA sequence will change the binding. The goal is to use state-of-the-art deep learning approach to discover potential, unverified binding sites.
